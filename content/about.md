Hi! My name is Alexander and I am a freelance photographer with a love for travel. My goal as a photographer is to capture and bring my clientsâ€™ visions to life through high-quality images with a minimalistic yet emotional feel. Therefore, I often incorporate Nordic minimalism with latin passion in my works, inspired by both Sweden and Colombia.

My work is mainly focused around people, both professionals and everyday individuals and I love shooting outdoors where nature or concrete can accenture the framing. You can often find me snapping portraits and getting lost in the great outdoors with my camera in hand.

Apart from photography, I enjoy life's simple pleasures - a good cup of coffee, exploring new places, a delicious meal, and watching movies. I believe these experiences make my work better and more meaningful. I look forward to working with you to create beautiful photos.
